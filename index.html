              >COVID-19 is a new illness that can affect your lungs and
              airways.</span
            >
            It's caused by a virus called coronavirus. It was discovered in
            December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
          </p>
          <p>
            Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever,
            cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more
            severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute
            respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.
          </p>
          <p>
            Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular
            hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing,
            thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone
            showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and
            sneezing.

                  People can fight stigma and help, not hurt, others by
                  providing social support. Counter stigma by learning and
                  sharing facts. Communicating the facts that viruses do not
                  target specific racial or ethnic groups and how COVID-19
                  actually spreads can help stop stigma.

                  People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and
                  relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19
                  is spreading. Some people are worried about the disease. Fear
                  and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, towards
                  Chinese or other Asian Americans or people who were in
                  quarantine.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of
                  people, a place, or a nation. Stigma is associated with a lack
                  of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame
                  someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that
                  spreads rumors and myths.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger towards
                  ordinary people instead of the disease that is causing the
                  problem.
